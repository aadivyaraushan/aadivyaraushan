# Hi, I’m Aadivya 👋

UIUC CS student building **verifiable AI systems, agentic LLM workflows, and production-grade web tooling** at the boundary of formal methods and deep learning. [page:1]

- 🔭 Currently: research on deterministic / verifiable LLM workflows at **FOCAL Lab (UIUC)** and shipping tools like **Plan‑Tain** and **Clara.ai**. [page:1]
- 🧠 Interests: formal languages for AI, agentic systems, GPU/cluster experimentation, and full‑stack infra that makes these usable. [page:1]
- 📍 Based in Champaign, originally from Dubai.

## Featured projects

Here are a few repos that best represent what I work on:

- **[lesson-plan-generator](https://github.com/aadivyaraushan/lesson-plan-generator)** – _LessonGPT_  
  LangChain + OpenAI pipeline that generates structured, syllabus‑aligned lesson plans; deployed for schools in Dubai and used by 120+ educators to create 1,300+ lessons. [page:1]

- **[ai-internship-finder](https://github.com/aadivyaraushan/ai-internship-finder)** – _AI internship outreach agent_  
  Agentic workflow that automates cold outreach for referrals using LLMs, APIs, and a modern TypeScript/Next.js stack. [page:1]

- **[plan-tain](https://github.com/aadivyaraushan/plan-tain)** – _Constraint-based class scheduling_  
  Constraint‑satisfaction engine and web app for UIUC students, generating non‑overlapping schedules and supporting social/peer features. [page:1]

- **[Clara.ai](https://github.com/NainaMKumar/Clara.ai)** – _Collaborative AI networking tool_  
  Contributions to an AI agent that streamlines networking and outreach, tying LLMs into a practical product surface. [page:1]

You can also browse my other repos for earlier work (blockchain, exam correctors, and more). [page:1]
