# Hi, I’m Aadivya 👋

I am a **Computer Science Freshman** at the **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)** (GPA 3.8/4.0).

Outside of being a student, I'm **founder**, **engineer** and **AI researcher**. Currently:

- 🚀 **Building:** Currently shipping **Refr** (AI recruiting agent) and **Plan-Tain** (scheduling platform for UIUC students).
- 🔭 **Research:** Undergraduate Researcher at **FOCAL Lab**, working on formal verification for agentic workflows.
- 📍 **Location:** Champaign, IL / Dubai, UAE.

## Featured Projects & Startups

### 🤖 [ai-internship-finder (Refr)](https://github.com/aadivyaraushan/ai-internship-finder)
**AI Agent for Automated Networking**
* **Production Architecture:** Built the MVP using a robust **Next.js 14 / TypeScript** stack with **PostgreSQL**, currently developing product-market fit with early users.
* **Real-Time Streaming:** Architected a pipeline using **Server-Sent Events (SSE)** to push asynchronous AI agent states to the client, solving latency issues in long-running LLM workflows.
* **Agentic Workflow:** Engineered autonomous agents using **LangGraph**, **Claude**, and **OpenAI** to automate professional outreach and referral matching.

### 📅 [plan-tain](https://github.com/aadivyaraushan/plan-tain)
**Constraint-Satisfaction Class Scheduler**
* **Algorithm:** Architected a **constraint-satisfaction engine** that generates non-overlapping schedules by pruning search spaces based on user constraints (GPA data, professor ratings, etc).
* **Product Lifecycle:** Managed the full product lifecycle from prototyping to beta, achieving high retention with 80% of early testers saying they'd regret not being able to use the app.
* **Testing:** Implemented **Jest** and **Playwright** pipelines for unit and E2E validation to ensure reliability during rapid deployments.

### 📚 [lesson-plan-generator](https://github.com/aadivyaraushan/lesson-plan-generator)
**RAG-based Educational Pipeline (LessonGPT)**
* **Scale:** A generative text pipeline that synthesized **1,300+ syllabus-aligned lesson plans** for **120+ educators**, reducing prep time by 70%.
* **Awards/Recognition:** Finalist (Top 8/300+) in GEMS Global Innovation Challenge; showcased at GITEX Global (200k+ attendees); presented to the UAE government; featured on Gulf News and by GEMS Education India recognized by CEO of GEMS Education.

## Research

**FOCAL Lab @ UIUC** _(July 2025 – Present)_
* Prototyping autonomous agentic workflows that integrate **deterministic finite automata**, **formal grammars**, and deep learning frameworks (Ray, PyTorch) to build formally verifiable AI.

**Independent Research** _(Published in IJNRD)_
* Authored a peer-reviewed study on gamification and adolescent productivity (published [here](https://ijnrd.org/viewpaperforall.php?paper=IJNRD2304333)).
* Conducted cross-sectional data analysis using Python and the **Wilcoxon rank-sum test**.

**Cambridge Centre for International Research** _(Summer 2023)_
* **Spotlight Scholar:** Explored quantum superposition and **Shor’s algorithm** through Python-based **Qiskit** simulations.
