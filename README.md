# Hi, I’m Aadivya

UIUC CS student building **verifiable AI systems, agentic LLM workflows, and production-grade full‑stack tools** at the boundary of formal methods and deep learning. [page:1]

## What I work on

- **Verifiable & deterministic AI**  
  Designing workflows that combine formal languages, deterministic structures, and deep learning to push LLMs toward predictable, checkable behavior. [page:1]

- **Agentic LLM systems**  
  Building multi-step AI agents that orchestrate tools, APIs, and context pipelines to automate complex tasks end to end. [page:1]

- **Full‑stack infra for AI**  
  Shipping systems with Next.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and cloud tooling that can actually be used: low-latency backends, real-time UX, and robust data models. [page:1]

## Recent highlights

- **LessonGPT** – AI lesson planner deployed in Dubai schools, using a LangChain-based context pipeline to generate 1,300+ structured, syllabus-aligned lesson plans for 120+ educators. [page:1]
- **FOCAL Lab (UIUC)** – Research on constraining probabilistic LLMs with formal methods to make their behavior more deterministic and verifiable. [page:1]
- **Plan‑Tain, Clara.ai, and related projects** – Constraint-based scheduling, internship/referral automation, and other agentic systems built with modern web stacks and AI tooling. [page:1]

## What I’m looking for

- Research and engineering on **formal-methods-inspired AI systems**. [page:1]  
- Work on **agentic workflows and LLM infrastructure** that touches real users. [page:1]  
- Collaborations that mix **theory-heavy AI** with **serious systems and product thinking**. [page:1]
